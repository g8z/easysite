WELCOME TO EASYSITE!

EasySite is a quick way to get a simple, content-managed website up and running. EasySite is "easy" not only because it's easy to set up, but because it's easy to administer. Special thanks to Alexander Pereverzev for his coding assistance for this version of EasySite.


****** WHAT YOU NEED ******

To install EasySite, you MUST have PHP 4.1.2 or better, and access to a server running MySQL. EasySite comes with a simple install.php script which will create the necessary MySQL tables and change the necessary configuration settings. You should also be able to change the permissions (CHMOD) files and folders, since this is necessary for the first step of the installer.


****** SETUP ******

Upload all of the files in the "public_html" folder to the public web space on your server. Open install.php in a web browser.

Thus, after upload, you will go to:

http://www.your_server.com/install.php

... and then follow the on-screen instructions.

If you are using a version of EasySite prior to version 2.0, then you will need to install from scratch (this will essentially 'reset' your website). There is currently no upgrader for versions prior to 2.0. If you are using a version past 2.0, then should should still backup all of your files, and your database, before upgrading.

IMPORTANT: Please backup your entire system (database + web files) before attempting an upgrade. The upgrader has been well-tested, but there is always the chance for lingering bugs, especially when upgrading from versions prior to 3.2.x


****** GETTING ASSISTANCE ******

If you need specialized tools in EasySite or need some customization that is not available in the config.php file, then please email me at g8z@yahoo.com. I am sometimes willing to do such customizations for free if I think that they will benefit all users.

I am available for a $25 fee to install this script for you on your server. I will need the database login information and your server's FTP information. Please email me at g8z@yahoo.com if you would like this more advanced form of assistance.


****** LICENSE ******

The $5 puchase of EasySite includes: permission to use EasySite on a single domain (.com, .org, .net, etc.). Use of EasySite on additional domains requires additional $5 licenses.

Your purchase entitles you to free upgrades to EasySite for the life of the product.


****** ADDENDA ******

Since you are being given all of the source code, you may of course modify EasySite in any way that you wish, provided that you know a bit of programming, but you may not claim credit for EasySite or re-sell or re-distribute EasySite.

If you liked EasySite, then please go to whatever forum you downloaded it from (e.g. www.hotscripts.com) and give the program a favorable rating! Thanks. :)
