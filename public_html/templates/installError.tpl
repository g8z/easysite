      <span class=normal>The system has detected that <b>install.php</b> and/or <b>/install_files/</b> are still present on your server. You should delete those files immediately. This security alert will disappear when the <b>install.php</b> and/or <b>/install_files/</b> will be removed.

      <br /><br />You may also wish to adjust the permissions of the <b>templates_c</b>, <b>temp</b>, and <b>cache</b> folders to the minimum required file-writing permissions for your server, and the permissions of <b>config.php</b> to the minimum required file-reading permissions for your server. If you do not know how to do that, or if you do not know what the minimum required permissions are, please contact your website host.</span>
