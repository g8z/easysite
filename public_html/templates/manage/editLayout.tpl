  <td valign="top" width="100%">Select the Template Area to Edit:<br /><br />
  <div><a href="editSettings.php?area=visible">Visible Area</a> - This is the main wrapper where all content is placed, so its width affects the width of all other elements of the template. You may change the background, centering, and several display options in this area.</div><br />
  <div><a href="editSettings.php?area=main">Main Body Area</a> - Most text content is outputted into this area.</div><br />
  <div><a href="editSettings.php?area=a1">A1 Area</a> - Top left corner. This area may contain only a single background image. It's a good place to put your company or organization logo.</div><br />
  <div><a href="editSettings.php?area=a2">A2 Area</a> - Top right corner. This area may contain only a single background image.</div><br />
  <div><a href="editSettings.php?area=a3">A3 Area</a> - Bottom right corner. This area may contain only a single background image.</div><br />
  <div><a href="editSettings.php?area=a4">A4 Area</a> - Bottom left corner. This area may contain only a single background image. </div><br />
  <div><a href="editSettings.php?area=a5">A5 Area</a> - The top color bar. This is a very thin (usually 1 pixel wide and many pixels high) image, which repeats along the top X axis of the page.</div><br />
  <div><a href="editSettings.php?area=a6">A6 Area</a> - The right color bar. This is a very thin (usually 1 pixel high and many pixels wide) image, which repeats along the Y axis of the page, along the right side.</div><br />
  <div><a href="editSettings.php?area=a7">A7 Area</a> - The bottom color bar. This is a very thin (usually 1 pixel wide and many pixels high) image, which repeats along the bottom X axis of the page.</div><br />
  <div><a href="editSettings.php?area=a8">A8 Area</a> - The left color bar. Along with areas A5 and A1, this is one of the most common design paradigms in website templates. It is a very thin (usually 1 pixel high and many pixels wide) image, which repeats along the Y axis of the page, along the left side. It's frequently a place where the website menu is placed.</div><br />
  <div><a href="editSettings.php?area=footer">Footer Area</a> (not visible in the picture on this page) - This is a block of text which appears at the bottom of every page, immediately below the body content. You can change the content of the footer, as well as its display.</div><br />
  <div><a href="editSettings.php?area=screen">Screen Area</a> - All parts of the screen outside the page template.</div><br />
